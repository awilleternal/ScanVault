# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a clean, aesthetic web application that performs automated security scans on uploaded plugins (ZIP files) or repository URLs. The application integrates multiple security scanning tools including Semgrep (via WSL2), Trivy (via WSL2), and optionally OWASP Dependency Check (ODC) on Windows. Users can select which security scans to run, view results with severity classifications, receive suggested fixes, and download vulnerability reports. The application emphasizes automation testing with Playwright and maintains high code quality through MCP server integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upload a plugin as a ZIP file or provide a repository URL, so that I can analyze it for security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the web application THEN the system SHALL display a clean, modern interface with upload options
2. WHEN a user selects file upload THEN the system SHALL accept ZIP files
3. WHEN a user provides a repository URL THEN the system SHALL validate the URL format and accessibility
4. IF the uploaded file is not a ZIP format THEN the system SHALL display an error message and reject the upload
5. IF the repository URL is invalid or inaccessible THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to choose which security scanning tools to run, so that I can customize the analysis based on my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the upload is successful THEN the system SHALL display checkboxes for available scanning tools (Semgrep, Trivy, ODC)
2. WHEN a user selects scanning options THEN the system SHALL validate that at least one tool is selected
3. WHEN a user initiates the scan THEN the system SHALL display the selected tools and estimated scan time
4. IF no scanning tools are selected THEN the system SHALL prevent scan initiation and display a warning message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time progress of security scans, so that I know the system is working and can estimate completion time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a security scan starts THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator with current scanning tool
2. WHEN each tool completes THEN the system SHALL update the progress status
3. WHEN Semgrep runs via WSL2 THEN the system SHALL execute the scan and capture output
4. WHEN Trivy runs via WSL2 THEN the system SHALL execute the scan and capture output
5. WHEN ODC runs on Windows THEN the system SHALL execute the scan and capture output
6. IF any scan fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with remaining scans

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security professional, I want to view scan results with severity classifications, so that I can prioritize which vulnerabilities to address first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scans complete THEN the system SHALL display results grouped by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info)
2. WHEN displaying vulnerabilities THEN the system SHALL show vulnerability type, affected file/line, and description
3. WHEN a user clicks on a vulnerability THEN the system SHALL expand to show detailed information
4. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide summary statistics (total issues, breakdown by severity)
5. WHEN multiple tools find the same issue THEN the system SHALL deduplicate and merge findings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive suggested fixes for identified vulnerabilities, so that I can quickly remediate security issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a vulnerability has known fixes THEN the system SHALL display suggested remediation steps
2. WHEN displaying fixes THEN the system SHALL provide code examples or configuration changes where applicable
3. WHEN fixes are available THEN the system SHALL prioritize them by effectiveness and ease of implementation
4. IF no automated fix is available THEN the system SHALL provide general guidance and external references

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to download vulnerability reports, so that I can include them in security documentation and audit trails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scan results are available THEN the system SHALL provide download options for different report formats
2. WHEN a user requests a download THEN the system SHALL generate reports in PDF and JSON formats
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include scan metadata (timestamp, tools used, file analyzed)
4. WHEN downloading THEN the system SHALL use descriptive filenames with timestamps
5. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL include executive summary and detailed findings

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the application to have comprehensive automated tests, so that I can ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is developed THEN the system SHALL include Playwright end-to-end tests
2. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL cover file upload, URL input, scan execution, and result display workflows
3. WHEN tests execute THEN the system SHALL validate UI interactions and API responses
4. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate coverage reports
5. WHEN CI/CD runs THEN the system SHALL execute all tests and block deployment on failures

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want the codebase to maintain high quality standards, so that the application is maintainable and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL integrate with MCP servers for code quality analysis
2. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL run linting, formatting, and security checks
3. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the system SHALL require code review and quality gate passage
4. WHEN dependencies are added THEN the system SHALL scan for known vulnerabilities
5. WHEN the application builds THEN the system SHALL enforce TypeScript strict mode and ESLint rules

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle WSL2 integration securely, so that scanning tools can execute without compromising system security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing Semgrep THEN the system SHALL run commands in isolated WSL2 environment
2. WHEN executing Trivy THEN the system SHALL run commands in isolated WSL2 environment
3. WHEN processing user uploads THEN the system SHALL sanitize file paths and validate content
4. WHEN running scans THEN the system SHALL implement timeouts to prevent resource exhaustion
5. IF WSL2 is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully disable affected scanning options and notify the user
